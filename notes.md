## SocialGeeks SaintCon Presentation  

## Introduction (5 minutes)  
This morning we are going to be talking about a learning experience that was both fun and frustrating, punctuated by moments of extreme excitement and adrelline when a concept is grasped and a challenge is solved.  You will hear from a couple of the students that participated in the event. Finally we'll tell you where we are taking SocialGeeks and how you can help.  But first, lets reflect on what this is all about.  

*** momo slide ***  

SocialGeeks is a student leadership group that focuses on connecting students with industry professoinals on hands on projects and games.  Using these events and games as learning opportunites and an opportunity to develop leadership skills.  

The current educational model has room for improvement and we believe a big part of the problem is in the approach. The model of memorizing facts long enough to regurgitate them on a test without ever making a real world connection.   

This is ok and necessary for somethings, but it training not learning.  The information, even when remembered, is not useful in a creative matter.  We are imparting training, how to do something exactly as stated, not learning, where the information is understood and can be adapted to the situation, developing critical thinking skills.  By giving kids a hands on real world project to work on with a mentor they build memories and are forced to see beyond the theoretical and into the applied.  By making the projects open ended it is more realistic and allows the students to develop critical thinking skills where the knowledge can be applied in different ways to different situations.  

The 2013 Horizon report put together by the NMC and the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative describes the findings of the NMC Horizon Project, a decade-long research project designed to identify and describe emerging technologies likely to have an impact on learning, teaching, and creative inquiry in higher education.   

The 2013 horizon report stated that games and gamification of curiculum and classes will be happening at universities in the next 2-3 years.  There are many examples of it happening right now.  

I say this is great, but why wait until college to flex the critical thinking skills.  

But... We don't just want to teach kids to learn, we want to also build confidence and leadership skills.  

The lack of soft skills is a big problem in our industry (and many others).  Frustration with problems in our existing educational and social systems that can only be fixed by long term thinking over several generations.

Somebody asked xmission guy yesterday what the solution to the problems with the NSA was.  I believe that what we have is a result of a lot of short term thinking influenced with a bit of fear.  We believe the only way to solve the larger problems affecting us as an industry and society can really only be addressed by long term thinking and building better geeks over several generations.

Systems are getting more complex, not less.  If we give up on this war now, things will only get worse.

Since 2011 SocialGeeks has been actively working at the College of Southern Idaho putting on many events and lectures ranging from food to board games.  Over the last few years we have focused more nad more on computer security and the incredible learning opportunities that CTFs offer.  

## CTF Planning/Execution (10-15 minutes)  

The first and biggest problem was that we are still pretty new to competing in CTFs ourselves and we didn’t know what skill level to aim for.  We knew the students had little to no exposure to offensive computer security. It’s easy to make assumptions of others knowledge and we didn’t want to make it unsolvable, we also didn’t want to insult the students intelligence by making it too easy. On top of this everybody involved works full time and more so time was a limiting factor.  In the end we decided to reuse the OverTheWire NATAS challenge along with a few other challenges we picked up over the last year of playing CTFs. Despite going the firehose route, we were surprised and delighted to see the students had no problems filling in the gaps.

show slides from CTF while students talk.  

Introduction, ask high school student to stand. Point out that they are our future and ask for applause.  Would like to hear everybodies story of what path brought them to SaintCon, but today we will listen to two such stories.  

I'm proud to introduct Omar/Lexi

“Badges are currently in use or in development at institutions such as MIT, Carnegie Mellon, the University of California-Davis and Seton Hall. Organizations outside of higher education are issuing badges, too, including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, The U.S. departments of Veterans Affairs and Education, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the movie studio Disney-Pixar.”
