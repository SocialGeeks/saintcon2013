## Description of Your Presentation  
Through SocialGeeks, myself, friends, students and professionals have put on many hands on training and interesting lectures at the College of Southern Idaho.  Offering mentoring and a relaxed learning environment to complement and supplement traditional learning methods.  

For the last year some of us have started to participate in Capture the Flag events.  Although we have yet to make it past a qualifier round, everybody involved has been blown away at the amount of knowledge and learning we have been able to do in such a short time.  

Last December we started working on the idea of bringing a Capture the Flag event to the local Twin Falls High School students.  This presented quite a challenge as we had no idea how to bring such a broad subject to kids of all skill levels.    

We spent 5 months tackling this problem and training mentors to work with the kids.  We decided to use NATAS from overthewire.org as the main piece of our challenges as the web challenges are much easier to teach to beginners (compared to reverse engineering or memory exploitation).  We also reworked a couple of challenges that we had seen in other Capture the Flag events along with one of our own challenges.  

For the infrastructure we decided to run our challenge servers off of two RaspberryPi servers.  This way we could be up and going quickly if one went down.  Also it allowed us to give one away as a prize for our custom coded SSH challenge (won by a Freshman fyi).  

On May 4, 2013 it all came together beautifully.  We originally expected mostly seniors with coding experience.  What we got was 20 students of whom the majority were freshman and sophmores with no coding experience.  Despite this with 13 mentors and 13 hours everybody was using Kali linux and coding solutions by the end of the day.  

SocialGeeks Inc. is looking to build on this success and is building a hackerspace environment to train mentors to work with highschool students on projects (malware analysis, building servers, python...) and capture the flag events.  We would like to discuss our success so far and spark a conversation with event goers for future ideas and collaboration.  

If possible we will bring one of the participating students to discuss the event from their point of view.  I'm going to invite their instructor as well.  I will also try to bring along another SocialGeek or two that acted as mentors.    

## Equipment Requirements  
Projector would be nice, promise to not bore with typical powerpoint. ;-)  3-4 mics would be good, although I am still working on who I can bring to talk with me.  

## Audience/Attendee Participation  
Listen and Discuss

## Special Requirements/Information  
Hope this isn't too late.  I think the subject manner will be of value and interest for a security conference put on for the benefit of higher education (and the greater community).  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or anything else.
